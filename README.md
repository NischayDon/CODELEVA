# CodeLeva

**CodeLeva** is a **PC Building Simulator–based game** that teaches **programming and computer systems** through **hands-on simulation gameplay**.

Players learn by building, diagnosing, configuring, and optimizing virtual PCs — using **real code as an in-game tool**, not as isolated lessons.

---

## 🎮 What is CodeLeva?

CodeLeva is a **game-first learning platform**.

Instead of tutorials or quizzes, players:
- Assemble and repair virtual PCs
- Diagnose hardware and software failures
- Configure system settings and performance parameters
- Write scripts and programs that directly affect simulated PC behavior

Learning coding and systems thinking happens naturally as part of gameplay progression.

## ✨ Features

### 🖥️ PC Building & Simulation
- Realistic PC component assembly (CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU, storage, cooling)
- Compatibility checks, power draw, thermal behavior, and performance modeling
- Failure states such as overheating, crashes, boot failures, and bottlenecks

### 💻 Coding as Gameplay
- Write real code/scripts to:
  - Automate system tasks
  - Monitor performance
  - Optimize thermals and efficiency
  - Diagnose and fix system issues
- Secure in-game sandbox for code execution
- Coding directly influences simulation outcomes

### 🧠 AI-Driven Systems
- Mentor AI for contextual hints and explanations
- Diagnostic AI to analyze hardware/software issues
- Adaptive learning engine that personalizes missions and difficulty
- Gamification engine for XP, levels, economy, and progression balance

### 🎯 Progression & Game Systems
- XP and leveling system
- Skill trees (Hardware, Software, Networking, AI, Security)
- In-game economy (credits, parts, upgrades)
- Inventory management
- Sandbox/free-build mode for experimentation

---

## 🧩 Game Philosophy

- Game-first, education-embedded
- Learning by doing, not memorizing
- Failure as feedback, not punishment
- Coding as a tool, not a subject

CodeLeva rewards understanding, experimentation, and systems thinking.
